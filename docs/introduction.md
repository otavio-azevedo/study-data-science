# Introduction to Data Science - UNIVESP

## Scientific Method
The scientific method is a systematic iterative process that scientists use to investigate questions, gather evidence and develop explanations. It helps ensure that conclusions are based on reliable observations and logical reasoning rather than personal beliefs or assumptions. 

1. Observation – Asking a question.
2. Research – Gathering existing information about the topic to understand what is already known.
3. Hypothesis – Proposing a testable explanation or prediction based on observations.
4. Experimentation – Conduction controlled tests to gather data and see if the hypothesis is supported.
5. Analysis – Examining the data to identify patterns and results.
6. Conclusion –  Determining whether the hypothesis is supported or needs revision.
7. Communication – Sharing results with others for verification and further study.

## What is Data Science?
> "An interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge or insights from structured and unstructured data."

- Domain Knwoledge + Programming + Statistics
- Extract knowledge from data
- Forecasting
- Enable data driven decisions

## Data
Data is raw facts, figures or information. Can be structured, semi-structured or non-structured.

## Big Data
Refers to extremely large datasets, characterized by the 3 V's (volume, velocity and variety).

## Business Intelligence (BI) x Data Science
Business Inteligence focuses on analyzing historical data to guide decisions, while Data Science uses historical data to to predict future trends or outcomes using statistical models and machine learning, to guide decisions.

## Data Engineer x Data Scientist x ML Engineer x AI Engineer
Below is a brief description of each role.
Keep in mind that these may vary from company to company.
In some cases, it’s common to see overlapping responsibilities.
### Data Engineer
"Prepares and delivers the ingredients."
- Defines data infrastructure and pipelines
- Collect, clean and store large datasets
- Build and maintain data pipelines
- Ensure data quality, reliability and accessibility

### Data Scientist
"Creates the recipe (model/insights)."
- Explore and analyze data
- Build statistical or ML models
- Test hypotheses and make predictions

### ML Engineer
"Ensures the recipe works at scale."
- Productionize ML models
- Optimize performance and scalability
- Maintain model pipelines

### AI Engineer (Data Scientist + ML Engineer + application focus)
"Cooks a full dish for people to use"
- Implement ML models in AI applications
- Build end-to-end AI solutions (chatbots, recommendation engines, computer vision, NLP)
- Ensure scalability and efficiency of AI systems

## NumPy Library (Numerical Python)
NumPy is one of the most popular libraries in the data science ecosystem. It's main focus is on numerical arrays and multidimensional arrays manipulation, other famous libraries has been built on top of NumPy library.

> It provides: 
> - a powerful N-dimensional array object
> - sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
> - tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
> -  useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities

## Pandas Library (Panel Data)
Flexible and powerful data analysis and manipulation library for Python, providing labeled data structures similar to R data.frame objects, series and statistical functions.

Similar to NumPy, Pandas focuses on tabular and heterogeneous data, while NumPy is more suitable for homogeneous arrays.
